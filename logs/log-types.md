# Types of Log Files

Different types of log files can provide valuable information for 
identifying and investigating security incidents. 
Here are some common types of log files 
and the types of security incidents they can help identify:

## System logs

System logs, such as those generated by the Windows Event Viewer 
or the Linux syslog daemon, can provide information about system events, 
such as user logins, system shutdowns, and application crashes. 
System logs can also provide information about system configuration changes, 
such as changes to user permissions or firewall rules. 

System logs can help identify security incidents such as: 

- unauthorized access attempts, 
- malware infections, and 
- system misconfigurations.

## Application logs

Application logs, such as those generated by web servers, 
databases, and custom applications, 
can provide information about application events, 
such as user requests, database queries, and application errors. 

Application logs can provide information about user activity and behavior, 
such as login attempts and changes to user settings. 

Application logs can help identify security incidents such as:

- SQL injection attacks, 
- cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and 
- data breaches.

## Network logs

Network logs, such as those generated by firewalls, routers, 
and intrusion detection systems (IDS), 
can provide information about network traffic and activity, 
such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, 
and protocol types. 

Network logs can provide information about network security events, such as:

- intrusion attempts, 
- port scans, and 
- denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. 

Network logs can help identify security incidents such as 

- network intrusions, 
- malware infections, and 
- data exfiltration.

## Audit logs

Audit logs, such as those generated by compliance systems 
and access control systems, can provide information about 
user activity and compliance violations. 

Audit logs can help identify security incidents such as:

- insider threats, 
- unauthorized access attempts, and 
- compliance violations.

Log files provide valuable information for identifying 
and investigating security incidents. 
Companies and agencies collect and analyze log data from multiple sources 
to gain a comprehensive view of system and network activity. 
Organizations use log analysis to improve their security posture and 
better protect systems and data from potential threats.
